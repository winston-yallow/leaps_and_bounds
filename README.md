# Leaps and Bounds

Small game for GitHub Game Off 2019 made with the Godot Engine.

## Details

The theme for this jam is "LEAPS AND BOUNDS". This game takes place in a universe
where all objects are drifting away of each other. The speed of this drifting is
increasing over time. The player has to jump from object to object in order to reach
a target. However the jump distance of the player is limited. To increase the jump
distance limits the player can collect items.
