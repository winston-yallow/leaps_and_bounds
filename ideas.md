# Ideas

- Game takes place in space
- No gravity
- Floating objects
- Player needs to reach target
- Gaps between object increase over time
- Player has a harpoon like device to cast rope to objects
- When shooting rope the player will move to the target object
- Rope has a range
- Range of rope can be extended with collectable items
- Maybe the objects are all cubes?
- Player orientation could depend on the plane they are standing on
